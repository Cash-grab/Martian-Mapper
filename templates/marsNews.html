        <h2>Leopard Spots and Other Martian Mysteries</h2>
        <p>
            In June 2025, NASA released new high-resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) that have reignited the debate about life on Mars. Among the most intriguing features are the so-called <b>“leopard spots”</b> dark, circular patches that appear seasonally on the Martian surface, especially in the polar regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            These spots are believed to form when sunlight penetrates translucent carbon dioxide ice, warming the ground beneath and causing gas to erupt through the ice, carrying dark dust to the surface. While this is a physical process, the patterns and their seasonal recurrence have led some scientists to speculate about the possible role of microbial life, as similar processes on Earth can be influenced by biological activity.

        <h3>Other Signs: Recurring Slope Lineae & Methane Spikes</h3>
        <p>
            NASA has also observed <b>Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL)</b> dark streaks that appear to flow down Martian slopes during warm seasons. While initially thought to be evidence of liquid water, recent studies suggest they may be caused by dry granular flows. However, the presence of hydrated salts and the possibility of briny water cannot be ruled out.

        <p>
            Another tantalizing clue is the detection of <b>methane spikes</b> in the Martian atmosphere. On Earth, methane is often produced by living organisms, so its presence on Mars is a subject of intense interest. The source of Martian methane remains unknown, but it could be a sign of either geological or biological activity.

        <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
            NASA’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Jezero Crater, searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting samples for future return to Earth. With every new discovery, we get closer to answering the age-old question: <i>Are we alone in the universe?</i>
